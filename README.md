# renderCalculator

 create a calculator app dynamically in javascript how?
-The numbers and operations buttons created in JavaScript.

-The operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) are handled in JS.

-The input and output display updates via arrow functions and .textContent.

-Everything is contained in a single HTML file for easy testing.

How it works:
-The numbers and operations are stored in an array (buttons).

-The renderButtons arrow function creates the buttons dynamically.

-Clicking buttons calls handleButtonClick to update the input or calculate.

-calculateResult safely evaluates the string math expression.

-The display updates using the updateDisplay arrow function.

What I learned 
exploring arrow functions and understanding what their used for and it limits
I learned about distrucring and thats a really cool concept 
predictable scoping 
-Ididnt know you cal call a function right after calling it
handling multple operator 
XSS attacks
user strict
eval()
new anonymous JavaScript function
redering the buttons using appendChild and creating elements
